# KEGG Data Processing Pipeline

This repository contains scripts for processing KEGG data, classifying levels, and generating summary tables. The process involves downloading a text file from the KEGG database, running a Python script for pre-processing, and using R code for classification.

## Steps

1. **Download KEGG Data:**
   - Download the KEGG data from the following URL: [KEGG Data](https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/get_htext?ko00001.keg)

2. **Pre-process KEGG Data using Python:**
   - Run the Python script `KEGG_prprocess.py` to pre-process the downloaded KEGG data.

   ```bash
   python KEGG_prprocess.py

3.Classify Levels using R:

Run the R script classify_level.R to classify the data into different levels.
    # Example R script
library(dplyr)

# Your data processing code here
# ...

# Save results to files
write.table(result_level1, "result_level1.tsv", sep = '\t', row.names = FALSE)
write.table(result_level2, "result_level2.tsv", sep = '\t', row.names = FALSE)
write.table(result_level3, "result_level3.tsv", sep = '\t', row.names = FALSE)
**Usage**
described above
**Dependencies**
List any dependencies for running the scripts, such as Python libraries (for the Python script) and R packages (for the R script).
